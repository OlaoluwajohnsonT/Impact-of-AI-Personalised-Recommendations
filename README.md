# Impact-of-AI-Personalised-Recommendations
The proliferation of AI-driven personalised recommendation systems in e-commerce has raised questions around their efficacy, relevance to diverse consumer needs, and privacy implications. While AI offers convenience, there are concerns about its ability to reflect individual preferences fairly and transparently, as well as potential biases tied to socio-economic and cultural factors. Observing these issues, I, Olaoluwa J. Taiwo, a final-year student at the University of Central Lancashire, initiated this project as part of my final-year research.

This project comprises a dataset and detailed analysis based on a survey conducted with 188 participants. The survey explored consumersâ€™ engagement levels, satisfaction with AI recommendations, privacy concerns, and perceived relevance of the AI-driven suggestions on an e-commerce platform. The collected data includes demographic details alongside quantitative and qualitative responses, offering a comprehensive view of user perceptions.

In this study, I employed quantitative techniques, including descriptive and inferential statistics, to test hypotheses related to digital literacy, income, and the perceived usefulness of AI recommendations. Qualitative methods, such as thematic analysis, provided further insights into consumer concerns and suggested improvements. This research aims to inform best practices for AI recommendation systems, ensuring they are more inclusive, relevant, and trustworthy, ultimately fostering enhanced consumer satisfaction and loyalty.
